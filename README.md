# Generative Model-based Collective Variable Learning with Metastable State Identification

This repository contains code, data, and experiments related to our proposed generative model-based framework for learning physically interpretable collective variables (CVs) in molecular dynamics (MD) systems.

## ðŸ”¬ Overview

We introduce a **generative modeling approach** to construct collective variables that:
- Faithfully capture the metastable states in high-dimensional MD data
- Eliminate the need for hand-crafted feature engineering
- Ensure one-to-one correspondence between latent prior modes and MD metastable states

Our framework leverages:
- A prior distribution with **predefined local maxima**
- An invertible neural mapping to reconstruct the full-dimensional PDF
- A hybrid loss function to enforce **mode alignment** and **kinetic fidelity**

We demonstrate the method on **alanine dipeptide in aqueous solution**, where the learned CVs reproduce key metastable states and correctly reflect kinetic properties such as mean square displacement behavior.
